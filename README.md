Daniel’s guide to how to get the best IPTV

1.	You need a Coinbase Bitcoin account https://www.coinbase.com/home
2.	A good TV device – I recommend Onn 4k Pro from Walmart. Firestick also works, but may require some extra steps. Look up Downloader on google, but only as a last resort.
3.	A good IPTV service. I’ve tested over 10. There are hundreds of them, here are a few standouts. I RECOMMEND YOU DOING A ONE MONTH SETUP. These services can shut down at any time, but the one’s I’ve tried have been in operation for over 5 years.
a.	https://xtremehdiptv.org/view-plans/ (easy and live quick chat $16/mo, or $141 yearly)
b.	https://yeahiptv.com/ (easy but no live chat, email is fast response $15/mo, or $90 yearly)
c.	https://1dollariptv.com (a little more difficult, slower help response, but $10/mo, or $75 yearly)
4.	VPN – I highly recommend Proton VPN … you can also go with ExpressVPN. This will hide all your IP traffic on your TV device and your computer! Downloading either of these first on your computer and then on to your device via Google Playstore is easy. Downloading on firestick instructions are here https://protonvpn.com/support/firestick
5.	iMplayer - https://implayer.tv/home ... this is the app you’ll use for IPTV. Don’t use the default apps from any of the providers. You can customize this yourself for an extra $35 and use it for any IPTV service. I paid through Google Playstore. You control it. It’s worth it.
6.	iMplayer Syncs across devices: It can be setup with multiple IPTV services. It’s how I’ve tested. It can also sync across the same iMplayer services. So … if you have 2-3 TVs (and you paid for the concurrent streams) or you only want 1 stream at a time but want the same channels and groupings when you switch from your TV to your phone, that works, too.

SIDE NOTES:
1.	I’ve had a little buffering, but have been watching 9/19/2024 TNF with no issues. I’ve had some buffering on ESPN but there’s a backup ESPN channel on each of these.
2.	I will never go back to Youtube TV or other regular IPTV services.
3.	VPN is important… don’t skip that step.

FINAL NOTE:
1.	If you want me to do a video comparing the different 3 in the next month, I can do that
